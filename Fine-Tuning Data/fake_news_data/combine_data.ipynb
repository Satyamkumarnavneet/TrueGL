       "'Palestinians switch off Christmas lights in Bethlehem in anti-Trump protest: RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinians switched off Christmas lights at Jesus  traditional birthplace in Bethlehem on Wednesday night in protest at U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital. A Christmas tree adorned with lights outside Bethlehem s Church of the Nativity, where Christians believe Jesus was born, and another in Ramallah, next to the burial site of former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, were plunged into darkness.  The Christmas tree was switched off on the order of the mayor today in protest at Trump s decision,  said Fady Ghattas, Bethlehem s municipal media officer.  He said it was unclear whether the illuminations would be turned on again before the main Christmas festivities. In a speech in Washington, Trump said he had decided to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital and move the U.S. embassy to the city. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Trump s move  marked the beginning of a new approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and said it was an  historic landmark . Arabs and Muslims across the Middle East condemned the U.S. decision, calling it an incendiary move in a volatile region and the European Union and United Nations also voiced alarm at the possible repercussions for any chances of reviving Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking.

       "'Migrants Refuse To Leave Train At Refugee Camp In Hungary: Migrants Refuse To Leave Train At Refugee Camp In Hungary\\n\\nThousands of migrants flooded into a train station in the Hungarian capital Thursday after police lifted a two-day blockade, but some who boarded a train they thought was going to Germany ended up instead at a refugee camp just miles from Budapest.\\n\\nThe Associated Press reports that \"excited migrants piled into a newly arrived train at the Keleti station in Hungary\\'s capital despite announcements in Hungarian and English that all services from the station to Western Europe had been canceled. A statement on the main departures board said no more trains to Austria or Germany would depart \\'due to safety reasons until further notice!\\'\\n\\n\"Many migrants, who couldn\\'t understand either language and were receiving no advice from Hungarian officials, scrambled aboard in a standing-room-only crush and hoped for the best,\" the AP said.\\n\\nScuffles broke out when police ordered the passengers off the train at Bicske, according to the BBC.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Hungary\\'s prime minister says his country is doing all it can to manage a growing migrant crisis, even as European officials said they will meet this month in Brussels to discuss an effort to \"strengthen the European response\" to the situation.\\n\\nViktor Orban said the influx of refugees into his country is really \"a German problem\" because that is the intended destination for most of them. Hungarians, along with other Europeans, are \"full of fear\" he says, because \"they see that the European leaders, among them the prime ministers, are not able to control the situation.\"\\n\\n\"If we would create an image ... just come because we are ready to accept everybody, that would be a moral failure, because that is not the case,\" Orban said after a meeting with European Parliament President Martin Schulz, according to The Washington Post. \"The moral human thing is to make clear, please don\\'t come. Why do you have to go from Turkey to Europe? Turkey is a safe country. Stay there. It\\'s risky to come.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Voice of America reports that British, French and German officials have called for urgent action and plan to hold talks on Sept. 14 in Brussels to address the crisis.\\n\\nVOA reports: \"The three ministers also called for better processing of migrants in Italy and Greece.\"\\n\\nAs we\\'ve reported, the United Nations believes that more than 300,000 migrants have set out for Europe from North Africa and the Middle East on the Mediterranean Sea so far this year, a 40 percent increase on all of last year.\\n\\nAs NPR\\'s Middle East editor Larry Kaplow writes: \"On any given day now, hundreds of people, perhaps thousands, are drifting in ships or clinging to boats that are little more than inflatable rafts. They go in other ways, too. Jumping fences in Morocco to get to Spanish territory. Cramming into trucks from Turkey. Riding trains across Europe.\"'"
